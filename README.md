# Drifting faces page

I made this when demoing V0 to a colleague. The prompt was the first thing that came into my head: 
"Make me a web page where faces drift horizontally across the window."

v0 chose to interpret that as a variety of canvas-based smileys, and chose the colour scheme. I thought it was very pleasant, so decided to
share it on Github.

I did subsequently prompt v0 to:

 - add clouds - I specified not using image assets, v0 chose everything else
 - randomise eyes, mouth, etc. independently
 - an easter egg suggested by someone I showed it to
